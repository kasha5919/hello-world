# hello-world
My new repository
I'm new to github and am creating a practice repository. So far, so good. My husband keeps coming in to talk to me, which is confusing the process a bit. But I think we'll get through it OK. 
Dogs are sleeping all over my office. One is sleeping on the floor. Another is sleeping on the futon. And yet a third is sleeping under the futon. 
My husband has asked me to clean the catbox. 
David Bowie is playing on the radio.
And so goes my evening.
